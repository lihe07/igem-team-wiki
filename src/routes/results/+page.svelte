  The filtration efficiency of all groups was measured using the method
  described on the measurement page. A microplastic suspension was prepared for
  standardizing the filtration efficiency test by diluting PS microspheres with
  diameters of 100nm, 1μm, 5μm, and 10μm. As evident from the previous
  description, the unchanging substrate is the BC membrane, while OP (oat
  protein), CBM3-CBM3, CBM3-OP-CBM3, APT, tannic acid, and tea polyphenols serve
  as optional additive materials.

  First, the experimental groups with varying concentrations of oat protein were
  tested for their microplastic filtration ability. Based on measurements, the
  it was determined that the optimal ratio for oat protein was 15wt%.

<p>
  When using oat protein alone, the filtration efficiency was measured at
  75.51%. However, the sponge's structure(just like in the literature) limited
  its practical application. In the experimental group where bacterial cellulose
  and oat protein were combined through the Maillard reaction, a noticeable
  increase in removal efficiency was observed, improving from 77.36% to 85.57%.
  This demonstrates that oat protein indeed has the effect of increasing
  microplastic adsorption sites. Through testing different ratios, it was
  determined that the optimal oat protein concentration is 15wt% (concentration
  2).

  The experimental group that only contains CBM3-CBM3 and BC achieved a removal
  efficiency of 79.77% for the microplastic mixture. In the group containing OP
  (CBM3-OP-CBM3), the removal efficiency increased to 91.70%. This result aligns
  with the outcomes of computer simulations, suggesting that specific functional
  groups on the target protein's side chains, as well as its isoelectric
  characteristics, may facilitate electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
  with microplastics, enhancing the adsorption of composites to microplastics.
  The increase in adsorption efficiency proves the effectiveness of our system.

<p>
  The measured removal efficiency of BAM for the MP mixture was 96.17%, while
  Jiang et al. reported an efficiency of 99.81%. The discrepancy between these
  results may stem from slight human errors, or it could also be attributed to
  the use of a broader range of PS microspheres in our MP suspension (Jiang et
  al. employed 100nm, 0.5μm, and 1μm PS microspheres, whereas we used
  microspheres with diameters of 100nm, 1μm, 5μm, and 10μm). However, overall,
  the observed filtration effectiveness of BAM for microplastics is excellent.
  This suggests that APT, as the sole additive on the BC membrane, plays a
  primary role in enhancing filtration performance.
</p>

<p>
  Due to the exceptional enhancement of adsorption efficiency by APT, we decided
  to test its combination with CBM3-OP-CBM3, which resulted in the best removal
  efficiency among all experimental groups, achieving 98.15%. One possible
  reason for this improvement is the addition of composite proteins enhances the
  strength and fiber structure of bacterial cellulose. Additionally, due to the
  properties of oat protein, it improves the membrane's porosity and enhances
  the interaction between the experimental membrane and microplastics.
  Consequently, it strengthens the filtration efficiency for larger and a wider
  range of microplastic sizes.

  Considering the high cost of synthesizing and purifying composite proteins
  (CBM3-OP-CBM3), we explored the use of tannic acid, as mentioned in a recent
  publication, which also has microplastic adsorption capabilities. We also
  tested a similar substance, tea polyphenols. Tannic acid, due to its low cost
  and excellent performance, was combined with oat protein, resulting in a
  filtration efficiency of 92.35%. On the other hand, tea polyphenols achieved a
  filtration efficiency of 80.10%. This provides more options for our product's
  future industrial applications, increasing the versatility of membrane
  components.
