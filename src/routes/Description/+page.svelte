<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>
  This project aims to address the issue of human ingestion of microplastics by
  designing a special bottle cap with filtration capabilities for bottled water.
</p>

<p>
  Microplastics (MPs) are plastic fragments and particles with a diameter of
  less than 5 millimeters, released during the use of plastic products (National
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], 2009). A global survey on
  drinking water quality revealed that approximately 325 microplastic particles
  ranging from 6.5 μm to 100 μm in size were found per liter in bottled water of
  various brands (Mason et al., 2018). These microplastics primarily leach into
  the water during the transportation process from the PET plastic bottles and
  HDPE bottle caps.

  {`The consumption of bottled water has become common in life. As a result, we passively ingest a certain amount of microplastics, and the part that cannot be excreted by the human body accumulates over time and breaks down into smaller nanoparticles (<100 nm). This accumulation poses health risks. Increasing research has found plastic fragments in human fluids and tissues, such as blood and placenta. MPs can j-penetrate "impermeable" barriers like the intestinal mucosal.`}
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, our team is attempting to design a novel bio-composite material to
  mitigate the health risks associated with ingesting microplastics. The product
  we are designing is a special bottle cap with both filtration and microplastic
  adsorption capabilities. Its simple structure involves attaching
  bio-engineered membrane to a rigid support structure made of organic polymers.

<p>
  We apply both filtration and adsorption mechanisms to maximize the reduction
  of microplastic content in bottled water. Ideally, the drinking water obtained
  through this bottle cap will contain virtually no microplastics, providing a
  cleaner source of drinking water and reducing passive microplastic ingestion.
</p>

<p>
  In the realm of biological materials, we have chosen Bacterial Cellulose (BC)
  as the substrate, produced by cultivating bacterial cellulose membranes (BCM)
  using Acetobacter xylinum. BC is a renewable material known for its
  non-toxicity and low environmental impact, making it widely applicable in
  various industrial contexts (de Oliveira Barud et al., 2016). Moreover,
  BC-based membranes exhibit high mechanical flexibility, chemical modification
  potential, and biocompatibility, making them ideal for water treatment (Wang
  et al., 2019).
</p>

<p>
  After modifying the bacterial cellulose membrane in the aforementioned two
  steps, we have obtained the biological filtration membrane portion of our
  designed bottle cap. Regarding the rigid support portion, given the uniqueness
  of our project design, we have opted to obtain samples of the support
  structure through 3D printing. By using all-cellulose ink, we are able to
  create lightweight, super-strong, highly elastic, and highly resilient
  all-cellulose support structures (Jiang et al., 2021).
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion, by combining the biological material and the rigid support
  portion, we can successfully produce the envisioned microplastic filtration
  bottle cap.
