<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>
  This project aims to address the issue of human ingestion of microplastics by
  designing a special bottle cap with filtration capabilities for bottled water.
</p>

<p>
  Microplastics (MPs) are plastic fragments and particles with a diameter of
  less than 5 millimeters, released during the use of plastic products (National
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], 2009). A global survey on
  drinking water quality revealed that approximately 325 microplastic particles
  ranging from 6.5 μm to 100 μm in size were found per liter in bottled water of
  various brands (Mason et al., 2018). These microplastics primarily leach into
  the water during the transportation process from the PET plastic bottles and
  HDPE bottle caps.

  {`The consumption of bottled water has become common in life. As a result, we passively ingest a certain amount of microplastics, and the part that cannot be excreted by the human body accumulates over time and breaks down into smaller nanoparticles (<100 nm). This accumulation poses health risks. Increasing research has found plastic fragments in human fluids and tissues, such as blood and placenta. MPs can j-penetrate "impermeable" barriers like the intestinal mucosal.`}
