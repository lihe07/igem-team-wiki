  Finally, to ensure the future successful implementation of our project, we
  wrote emails to major mineral water companies, elaborating on the operational
  principles of our product. We emphasized its integration within the existing
  production chains of mineral water and sought societal-level suggestions.
  (Email records and chat transcripts are available.) Ultimately, we received a
  response from the Wahaha Mineral Water Company in China. We successfully
  conducted a video conference with their representatives, including:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Guo Taisong: Master, Zhejiang University; Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. LTD;
    Leader of mold and packaging R&D team
  </li>

  <li>
    Yu Fang: Xi 'an University of Architecture and Technology, Master; Hangzhou
    Wahaha Group Co. LTD; Product design engineer;
  </li>

  <li>
    Xu Wen: Jiangnan University, Master; Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. LTD;
    Packaging technology engineer;
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Their suggestions mainly include the following aspects, and we have made
  improvements and replies one by one:
</p>

<h4>Durability</h4>

<p>
  <b>The Company:</b> Sterilization measures using ozone, sodium hypochlorite and
  other disinfectants may damage the structure
</p>

<p>
  <b>Us:</b> Theoretically, since surface treatment is used, sterilization measures
  will not affect the internal structure. However, we do not rule out the possibility
  that it may cause damage, and we will test and improve the samples after they are
  completed.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The Company:</b> In real life, the pressure of squeezing the bottle may cause
  the pore size of the membrane to increase.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Us:</b> No, because the support structure itself is fixed to a separate steel
  support structure, squeezing will not deform the membrane and will not change the
  aperture of the membrane.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The Company:</b> When sealing, the cap leaves an excess when it comes into contact
  with the mouth of the bottle, and this excess causes the membrane to wear out.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Us:</b> Similarly, because the membrane is fixed in a steel support structure,
  most of the time it does not rub directly against the cap structure, so the impact
  of wear is small.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The Company:</b> Cellulose contains hydrophilic groups, will it swell when exposed
  to water for a long time?
</p>

<p>
  <b>Us:</b> The process we use is from the straw production process, this process
  will make a surface treatment to the cellulose, separating the hydrophilic groups
  of cellulose and the outside, thus the support result will not absorb water.
</p>

<h4>Production</h4>

<p>
  <b>The company: </b>In the production line, the mechanical analysis of in the
  robotic arm screwing the bottle cap, as well as the strength analysis of
  cellulose.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Us: </b>For the convenience of the robotic arm and the user, we designed
  the periphery of the bottle cap with bumps, making it easier for humans and
  instruments to grip.
