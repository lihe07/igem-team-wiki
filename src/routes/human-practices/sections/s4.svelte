  There are many types of water, and domestic wastewater is a critical source of
  microplastic pollution. The assessment shows that “every person (in the
  studied area) emits on average 1145 microplastics (25–1000 μm) daily through
  domestic wastewater, resulting in a yearly discharge of 418,000 microplastic
  particles per person”. [5]

  What is related to domestic wastewater is water treatment plants which play a
  pivotal role in the operation of cities and companies, so we initiated the
  roadmap for discovering wastewater filtration to better understand its
  function.

  Consequently, our initial goal was set: <b
    >starting from large-scale wastewater filtration plants, we aimed to learn
    their filtration mechanisms and apply this technology to various operations
    including other types of wastewater that end up in the ocean, air, and human
    body, and therefore effectively filter out microplastics from water sources.</b
