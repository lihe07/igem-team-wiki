  In the filtration system, the role of membranes is always pivotal. Vice
  Director Zhang provided us with an excellent subject of study, prompting us to
  delve deeply into MBR research.

  Through extensive literature research, we discovered that the utilization of
  chemical agents in MBR treatment has significant environmental repercussions,
  such as membrane fouling, accelerated protein and bacteria adsorption, and
  pollution[6]. Nevertheless, the literature also hints at the potential of
  biological cleaning methods. Inspired by this, we devised Plan A, with the
  objective of employing genetic engineering techniques to develop enzymes
  capable of degrading pollutants. This innovation aims to enable a wider
  adoption of biological reactor technology in water treatment plants, thereby
  alleviating membrane fouling issues and enhancing the filtration of water
  sources. By promoting the broader utilization of such membranes, we can
  effectively address the problem of microplastics in water across various
  large-scale water treatment plants.
