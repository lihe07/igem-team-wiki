  In our literature review, we initially explored the significant rise in
  microplastics (MPs) based on an article published by The Guardian. This
  article briefly outlines the situations in which people are known to ingest
  these minuscule particles through food, water, and even inhalation[1].
  Additionally, recognizing the essential role of water in our lives, we focused
  our attention on freshwater environments, investigating the presence of MPs in
  rivers, surface water, reservoirs, and groundwater[2]. Notably, research in
  China has already been conducted to uncover the occurrence of MPs in
  freshwater sources[3].

  As a result, our team embarked on extensive research to address the issue of
  microplastics in freshwater. Our efforts led us to identify three potential
  avenues of action, which are summarized briefly as follows:
