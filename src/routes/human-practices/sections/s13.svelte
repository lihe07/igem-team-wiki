<h4>Strength</h4>

<p>
  <b>Consumers:</b> When hit by sharp objects, the filter membrane may be damaged.
</p>

<p>On this issue, we have further optimized the project.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Stainless steel is added on both sides of the membrane as a support. Set the
    membrane behind the bottle mouth to absorb shock
  </li>

  <li>
    The material used to make the bottle cap is elastic. Through continuous
    testing and improving the mixed ratio, the bottle cap can act as a shock
    absorber.
  </li>

  <li>
    Due to time limits, we will improve the manufacturing process of the
    membrane to make it more durable in the future.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Overall, these improvements make the product more reliable, better able to
  meet user needs and prolong the service life of the product. Increasing the
  strength and elasticity of the membrane will make it less likely to break
  easily.

<h4>Production/sustainable development</h4>

<p>
  <b>Consumers: </b>The filter bottle has a single form and may be difficult to
  adapt to various bottles on the market.
</p>

<p>
  While ensuring the application of biofiltration membrane technology, we
  conducted detailed research. According to our research, most bottled water
  caps on the market now adopt a threaded form, which is very common. Therefore,
  we can solve the problem of bottle size through simple size adjustments. This
  adjustment can be achieved very easily without any negative impact on the
  performance of the bottle. Through this improvement, we can ensure the
  application results of biofiltration membrane technology and make it more
  suitable for bottled water products on the market.
