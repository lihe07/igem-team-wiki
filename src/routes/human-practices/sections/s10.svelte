<h3>Theoretical verification</h3>

<p>
  After confirming our project's target audience, we consulted literature to
  confirm the presence of microplastics in bottled water. Through literature
  review, we found that in all bottled water, PET packaging had higher
  concentrations of microplastics compared to other types of packaging,
  indicating that this packaging is a source of plastic pollution. The
  literature reported microplastic content in glass bottles and PET bottles,
  with values of 204 particles per liter (p/L) and 1410 p/L respectively.
  Plastic items in glass bottles, specifically the plastic layer under the
  bottle cap, might also release microplastic particles into the bottled water.
  Literature has proven that a significant portion of microplastic pollution in
  bottled water comes from mechanical forces experienced by bottles during their
  whole life cycle, such as squeezing, cleaning, transportation, and storage.
  Therefore, we conducted preliminary experiments to confirm the presence of
  microplastics in bottled water.

<p>
  We sampled and tested bottled water and beverage brands ranking in the top six
  in market share in both the Chinese and international markets (Aquafina,
  Nongfu Spring, YiBao, Baishan, Kangshifu Mineral Water, Nestle Pure Life,
  Kangshifu Ice Tea, and Coca-Cola). We measured the quantity of microplastic
  particles in each bottled water, confirming the existence of microplastic
  pollution in the bottled water and beverages we consume in our daily lives.

<p>
  From our literature review, we learned that bottle caps were considered the
  main factor responsible for releasing microplastics. Therefore, replacing
  existing plastic bottle caps is the most effective solution to mitigate
  microplastic pollution. Additionally, innovative packaging technologies that
  allow opening the bottle cap in a different way, such as "easy-open caps,"
  could be a potential solution to reduce particle release. Consequently, we
  discussed solutions for microplastic pollution and ultimately decided to add a
  simple microplastic filtration device to the bottle mouth (Please refer to the
  description page for details). The materials used in this device are entirely
  eco-friendly. The device include two parts: a filter membrane capable of
  trapping microplastics and a special bottle cap made from cellulose structure.
  The cellulose structure of the bottle cap can reduce microplastic pollution
  generated from the production and use of plastic bottle caps. Therefore, the
  wet team began to design the filtering process used at the bottle mouth. Our
  design theory, confirmed by Professor A, was proven to be feasible. The
  specific process can be viewed here:

<h3>Testing in real life</h3>

<p>
  After synthesizing the BAM membrane, we needed to conduct BAM membrane
  effectiveness testing on water samples containing microplastics. The
  preparation of the microplastics water sample was performed using the
  following steps:
</p>

<p>Materials used:</p>

<p>- PS microplastics 0.1mm microspheres (purchased from [source])</p>

<p>
  1.1g of plastic microspheres was extracted using an iron spatula. The plastic
  microspheres were ground for 1 minute using a 6cm ceramic mortar and pestle.
</p>

<p>
  The submerged plastic powder was stirred with 1000ml of ultrapure water using
  a glass rod for one minute.
</p>

<p>
  Both the pre-test and post-test samples were enriched and sent for inspection
  using the same procedures as the water sample analysis described earlier. The
  results of the Raman spectroscopy testing on the pre-filtered samples were
  similar to the previously presented results, with peak heights resembling the
  PS spectra in the database. This confirmed that the water samples prepared
  were essentially free from external microplastic contamination. The results of
  microplastic content detection showed a 97% reduction in microplastic content.
