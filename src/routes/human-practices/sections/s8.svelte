  Drawing upon our previous experiences working with the JingKai water treatment
  plant, we introduced Plan B, which, we opted to design a bottle cap equipped
  with filtration capabilities. <b
    >This cap would serve as the final line of defense, preventing human
    consumption of microplastics.</b
  > Unlike the filtering system we knew from JingKai water plant, we hope this bottle
  cap can be environmentally friendly, and also specialize in addressing microplastic
  ingestion from everyday plastic-packaged drinking water. Moreover, we wish this
  little cup can be applied to other containers and drinking devices (such as coffee
  or beverage cups), showing more flexibility than the filtering system in the water
  treatment plant.
