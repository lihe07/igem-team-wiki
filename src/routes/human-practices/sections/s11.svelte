<h3>Design and produce</h3>

<p>
  After confirming that the problem indeed existed in bottled water, our wet lab
  began to design the filtering process used at the bottle mouth. (Our design
  theory was proven to be feasible after being confirmed by Professor A. The
  specific process can be viewed here lab链接】)
</p>

<SectionHeader title="Fixation" subtitle="" />

<p>
  Upon the theoretical design completion of our initial bottle cap version, we
  commenced soliciting feedback from various stakeholders in society. Our
  shareholders include: filtering engineer, a consumer representative, and a
  representative from the Bottled Water
  Company.(这三类人在拍版的时候最好有三个大块，每块中有介绍)
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The filtering engineer provided a feasibility analysis of our product's
    design, focusing on its technical aspects.
  </li>

  <li>
    The consumer representative offered suggestions regarding the user
    experience.
  </li>

  <li>
    Bottled Water Company representative elucidated potential challenges that
    might arise during actual production.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  By amalgamating the insights from these three categories of shareholders, we
  were able to comprehensively refine our product. This iterative process
  allowed us to explore new possibilities in the realm of mineral water
  filtration.
